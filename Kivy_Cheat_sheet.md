# Kivy Framework Cheat Sheet

If you are writing in Python 3

On the top of the python `main.py` file put:

```python

from __future__ import (absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals)
from builtins import *

```

These two lines are not necessary but recommended, they will ensure that your code is Python 2 compatible, some packagers like Buildozer works better with Python 2

In all applications the following imports should be done:

```python

import kivy
kivy.require('1.10.0')  # replace with your current kivy version !
from kivy.app import App

```
Controling the initial window size of the kivy app:

*Before the window creation:*
```python

from kivy.config import Config
Config.set('graphics', 'width', '200')
Config.set('graphics', 'height', '200')     # put your desired values instead of 200

```

*Or dynamically After The window creation:*

```python

from kivy.core.window import Window
Window.size = (300, 100)

```

## Typical Python `main.py` file:

```python
import kivy
kivy.require('1.10.0')
from kivy.app import App

class TypicalApp(App):
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    MyApp().run()

```
## A simple typical Kivy `typical.kv` file:

```yaml

#:kivy `1.10`   # kivy header line to declare the kivy version used

BoxLayout:    # The root layout(widget), can be offcourse any other type of layout
    someproperty:
    someproperty:
    someproperty:
    someproperty:

    SomeAnotherWidget:  #This is a direct child of the root layout(widget)
        someproperty:
        someproperty:
        someproperty:
        someproperty:
        someproperty:


    SomeLayout: # this is another layout that will be included in the first root layout, usually this is not needed
        someproperty:
        someproperty:
        someproperty:

        SomeWidget:     # this is a child of the second layout
            someproperty:
            someproperty:
            someproperty:

```

## A typical Kivy `typical.kv` file with a custom layout:

```yaml

#:kivy `1.10`   # kivy header line to declare the kivy version used

TypicalScreen:    # The root widget which is a custom widget defined below but only called beacuse of this line, i.e.: TypicalScreen:
<TypicalScreen@BoxLayout>:
## Defining our custom widget, The `<` `>` means that this is a class, the `@` means it inherits from the `BoxLayout` layout class, the BoxLayout can be changed to any other layout or widget
## The above line is equivalent in python to :
# class TypicalScreen(BoxLayout):
#   def __init__(self,**kwargs):
#        super(TypicalScreen, self).__init__(**kwargs)
## And offcourse this will mean the following change in the App subclass:
# class MyApp(App):
#     def build(self):
#        return MyScreen()
## Offcourse this will complicate things up, so subclassing the widget in the kivy file as shown here is preferred
    someproperty:
    someproperty:
    someproperty:
    someproperty:

    SomeAnotherWidget:  #This is a direct child of the root layout(widget)
        someproperty:
        someproperty:
        someproperty:
        someproperty:
        someproperty:


    SomeLayout: # this is another layout that will be included in the first root layout, usually this is not needed
        someproperty:
        someproperty:
        someproperty:

        SomeWidget:     # this is a child of the second layout
            someproperty:
            someproperty:
            someproperty:


```


## Available layouts
*And their respective import statemnts*
```python
from kivy.uix.anchorlayout AnchorLayout

from kivy.uix.floatlayout import FloatLayout

from kivy.uix.gridlayout import GridLayout

from kivy.uix.pagelayout import PageLayout

from kivy.uix.relativelayout import RelativeLayout

from kivy.uix.scatterlayout import ScatterLayout

from kivy.uix.stacklayout import StackLayout

```

> Tip: in any python file, make an import to one of the above layouts, lets' say AnchorLayout, Then in a new line type: `AnchorLayout.` then using the code completion feature in your text editor\IDE, view the available attributes in this class together with the description (documentation) available for it, the attribute name in any class is the same name that can be used in the `.kv` file, with this method you can understand a lot about every class in the kivy framework, also play around with the methods (functions) available in this class. This trick is one of the main methods that was used to make this cheat sheet.

## Available Classical Widgets

*And their respective import statemnts*
<!--TODO:Add the class name that should be imported after making sure of the correct import statement-->
```python

from kivy.uix.label import Label

from kivy.uix.button import Button

from kivy.uix.checkbox

from kivy.uix.image

from kivy.uix.slider

from kivy.uix.progressbar

from kivy.uix.textinput

from kivy.uix.togglebutton

api-kivy.uix.stencilview

```
## Screen Manager

*And their respective import statemnts*
<!--TODO:Add the description of every widget-->

```python

api-kivy.uix.screenmanager

```
## Widget Examples:

### GridLayout

* Python:

```python

from kivy.uix.gridlayout import GridLayout

```

* Kivy:

```yaml

GridLayout:
    spacing: 10     #Spacing between children i.e.: widgets, can be : x,y (horizontal spacing, vertical spacing), or can be one argument only, defaults to 0,0 if not added
    padding: 10     # Padding between the layout box and it's children, can be 4 arguments (left,top,right,bottom), or 2(horizontal,vertical), or one only, defaults to 0,0,0,0 if not added
    cols: 2     # Number of columns in the grid, defaults to 0
    rows: 2     # Number of rows in the grid, defaults to 0
    col_default_width: 0    # Default minimum size to use for a column, defaults to 0
    row_default_height: 0   # Default minimum size to use for row, defaults to 0
    col_force_default: False    # If True, ignore the width and size_hint_x of the child and use the default column width, default is False
    row_force_default: False    # If True, ignore the height and size_hint_y of the child and use the default row height, default is False

```

## Scheduling events:

```python
#....
from kivy.clock import Clock
# Method 1:
event = Clock.schedule_interval(function, interval)   # This method will trigger the function every some interval (seconds)

# But the function passed here must have a patameter of delta time as an argument in its signature

def function(dt):
    # some code
# the dt parameter is not needed to be used in the function

# Method 2:
event = Clock.schedule_once(function, delay)    # This will trigger function once only after some delay in seconds

# Again this function should have 'dt' as an argument
# Off course if this function is part of a class, it should look like this:

def function(self,dt):
    # some code

# If at some condition or at some point in your code, you need to disable the scheduled event, i.e. unschedule it, use:
event.cancel()

# Or:
Clock.unschedule(event)

# Or in the signature of the function itself, return False at the desired cancelation condition

```

## Controling the environment

```python
import os
os.environ["KIVY_NO_CONSOLELOG"]= "1"   #This will prevent printing logs to the console
import kivy     # the previous line should be before importing kivy
```
